# Understanding the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
This repository contains code extracts from a data analysis project I worked on as part of the Career Foundry Data Analytics Bootcamp.

This was the final project of the course and I chose to analyse 40 years' of tsunami and earthquake data (1985 - 2024). I was inspired by the recent media coverage of the 40-year anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami, the deadliest natural disaster in recorded history, which killed an estimated 228,000 people across 15 countries. I wanted to understand what features of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami made this particular event so devastating.

You can view the [corresponding Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/views/2004_Indian_Ocean_Tsunami/TsunamiAnalysis?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) online. This doesn't include all steps taken during the analysis, only those relevant to the final results.


## Data Sources

This repository includes data from various sources, each referenced with the date of generation.

## Learning outcomes
The main purpose of this project was to further develop my knowledge of Python and as well as the end-to-end data analysis process.
